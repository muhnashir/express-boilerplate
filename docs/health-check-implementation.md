# Health Check Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to implement a comprehensive health check system in the Express.js boilerplate application.

## Changes Made

1. **Created Health Check Controller**
   - File: `src/app/ucase/health.controller.js`
   - Implemented basic and detailed health check endpoints
   - Added system resource monitoring (memory, CPU, platform)
   - Added database and Redis connection checks
   - Implemented status determination logic

2. **Created Health Check Router**
   - File: `src/app/router/health.js`
   - Set up dedicated routes for health checks
   - Used async handler for proper error handling

3. **Updated Existing Routes**
   - Modified `src/app/router/http.js` to use the new health router
   - Removed duplicate health check endpoint from `src/bootstrap/server.js`

4. **Added Documentation**
   - Created `docs/health-check.md` with comprehensive usage instructions
   - Updated Swagger API documentation with detailed schemas
   - Added reference to health check documentation in README.md

5. **Created Test Script**
   - File: `src/test-health.js`
   - Implemented tests for both health endpoints
   - Added user-friendly output formatting

## Testing

To test the health check endpoints:

1. Start the application:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Run the test script:
   ```
   node src/test-health.js
   ```

3. Or use cURL to test manually:
   ```
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health/detailed
   ```

## Next Steps

Potential future enhancements:

- Add metrics collection for Prometheus integration
- Implement custom health checks for external services
- Add historical health data storage
- Create a health dashboard UI
